The\r\n                  key difference between NFTs and cryptocurrencies is that\r\n                  currencies allow fungible trade, which means anyone can create\r\n                  Bitcoins that can be exchanged for other Bitcoins. NFTs are by\r\n                  definition nonfungible, and are deployed as individual chains\r\n                  of ownership to track a specific asset. NFTs are designed to\r\n                  restrict and represent a unique claim on an asset uniquely.\r\n                  The NFTs that we sell are not utility tokens and they will\r\n                  never be listed in any digital Exchange or Decentralized\r\n                  Exchange but in marketplaces like any other digital good.
